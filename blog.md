## Description of problem-solving ideas. 
Calculators need both front-end pages and back-end code to be implemented, and I considered two solutions. 
- Solution 1: Use java eclipse to implement directly, the advantage is that this is the compilation platform I am most familiar with, the disadvantage is that the style of the front end is very complex to implement. 
- Solution 2: Use JavaScript, the advantage is that the syntax is similar to JAVA, lightweight, front-end interface code implementation is simple and easy to understand. The disadvantage is never used, to learn. Based on the pros and cons of both options, I chose option two and started searching for simple JavaScript syntax in bilibili and CSDN.

## Design and implementation process. The design includes how the code is organized and the flow chart of the key functions.

## Code description. Show the key code of the project and explain the idea.

## Displaying result functions with screenshots ((or gifs) and text descriptions.

## Summarize this assignment.
